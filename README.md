# PythonCalculatorMidterm
This is the Python based modular application for arithmatic calculation. It also supports a dynamic plugin system feature. It includes the App class which is responsible for loading plugins and executing commands through a CommandHandler mechanism. The application contains different arithmatic operations like add, subtract, divide and multiply through its plugin system. The plugin folder contains all these arithmatic operation as command and it is loaded dynamically and registered using Command Handler. It also provides a calculation history management feature, allowing users to load, save, clear, and delete historical calculation records via a singleton instance of a CalculationHistory class. The calculation record is also saved in .csv file using panda library. Additionally, the project employs a LoggingUtility class for comprehensive logging across the application. The project's structure enables easy scalability, allowing for the addition of more complex operations or functionalities by simply adding new plugins.
